# World Weather Analysis

## Purpose

Our task is to incorporate regional weather data into a PlanMyTrip travel app to inform customers about the weather at their destination of choice. We'll use Jupyter Notebooks in conjunction with Pandas, Numpy, OpenWeather API queries, and finally Google Maps and Routing APIs.

## Results

Our end result provides the ability to query current weather data from popular travel destinations and generate heatmaps with Google Maps, as well as provide custom routing itineraries.
